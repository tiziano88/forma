Keep changes small, and check that the code still compiles after each change, by running `pnpm -r build`.

Add type annotations for all methods, and avoid using `any`.

Do not try to use git in this repository.

Before considering a request completed, format the project with `just format` and make sure everything compiles and tests are passing, if relevant.
